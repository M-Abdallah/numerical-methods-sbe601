# Introduction to Schrodinger Equation

Erwin Schrodinger derived the equation in 1925, he was trying to come up with an equation to explain the motion of particles in the Quantum Realm.

$$
\imath \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \vert \psi (r,t)\rangle = [ \frac{-\hbar}{2\mu} \nabla^2+ V(r,t) ]\vert \psi(r,t)\rangle 
$$
