### Schrodinger Equation

In 1925, an Austrian scientist Erwin Schrodinger in a pursuit to find an equation explaining the states of particles in the Quantum realm.

The equation was first known for solving quantization problem; it was published by the name " **Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem** ". Later on, this equation solved some interesting problems in *Quantum Mechanics* like ***Quantum Harmonic Oscillator***, ***Infinite Square Well***.
Schrodinger Equation is the backbone of *Wave Mechanics* for *Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics*.

The funny part is that Erwin Schrodinger the founder of *Wave Mechanics* for *Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics* and presumably one of the great minds behind the early nourishment of *Quantum Mechanics*, was not at ease with the implications of *Quantum Physics*; he himself wrote about saying: "I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it."

$$
\imath \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \vert \psi (\vec{r},t)\rangle = \left[ \frac{-\hbar}{2\mu} \nabla^2+ \mathcal{V}(\vec{r},t) \right]\vert \psi(\vec{r},t)\rangle
$$


We are planning to solve Schrodinger Equation using numerical methods
